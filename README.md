As a Social Media Manager at Ridgevue High School, I focused on promoting school athletics and enhancing community engagement through creative and impactful digital content. My responsibilities included designing visually appealing graphic posts, crafting engaging captions, and curating content to highlight the achievements and talents of student-athletes.  

I developed and executed social media strategies tailored to showcase the schoolâ€™s sports programs, ensuring consistent branding and tone. By analyzing audience engagement and feedback, I optimized posts to maximize reach and interaction. This role enhanced my skills in graphic design, time management, and social media marketing while fostering school spirit and community pride.
